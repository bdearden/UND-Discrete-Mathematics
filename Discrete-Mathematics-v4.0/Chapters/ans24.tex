\begin{Solution}{24.1}
A calculator would be handy for this problem. The plan is to try divisions by $2,3,5,7,11,13,$ and so on, until we have the complete factorization in to primes.

\[
345678 = (2)(172839) = (2)(3)(57613) = (2)(3)(17)(3389) 
\] 
Note that in testing for prime divisors of $3389$, we needed only test $17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 53, 29$.
With a calculator, the whole process took about two minutes. 

\end{Solution}


\begin{Solution}{24.2}


\[
1016 = (2)(508) = (2)(2)(254)= (2)(2)(2)(127)= 2^{3}127
\]

\end{Solution}

\begin{Solution}{24.3}

The positive divisors of $1016$ will look like $2^{a}127^{b}$ where $a = 0,1,2,3$ and $b = 0,1$.
Since there are four choices for $a$ and two choices for $b$, there will be a total of $(4)(2) = 8$ positive divisors of $1016$. They are:
\begin{align*}
2^{0}127^{0} &= 1\qquad
&2^{1}127^{0} &= 2\\
2^{2}127^{0} &= 4\qquad
&2^{3}127^{0} &= 8\\
2^{0}127^{1} &= 127\qquad
&2^{1}127^{1} &= 254\\
2^{2}127^{1} &= 508\qquad
&2^{3}127^{1} &= 1016
\end{align*}

\end{Solution}

\begin{Solution}{24.4}
The positive divisors of $345678$ will look like $2^{a}3^{b}17^{c}3389^{d}$ where $a,b,c,d$ can each be either $0$,or $1$. So, there will be a total of $(2)(2)(2)(2) = 16$ positive divisors of $345678$.

\end{Solution}
