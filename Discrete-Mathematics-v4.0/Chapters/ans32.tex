\begin{Solution}{32.1}


If we distribute eight objects (people) into seven piles (days of the week),
there will be at least one pile (day) with $\lceil\frac{8}{7}\rceil = 2$ objects (people).

\end{Solution}

\begin{Solution}{32.2}

If we distribute $100$ objects (people) into seven piles (days of the week),
there will be at least one pile (day) with  $\lceil\frac{100}{7}\rceil = 15$ objects (people).

\end{Solution}

\begin{Solution}{32.3}

Since there are four suits (piles), we need the least value of $n$ so that $\lceil\frac{n}{4}\rceil = 6$.
That will $5\cdot 4 + 1 = 21$. 

\end{Solution}

\begin{Solution}{32.4}
Let $a_{1}, a_{2},\ldots ,a_{n}$ be $n$ integers. They are each equivalent to one of $0,1,2, \ldots, n-2$ modulo $n-1$.
Since there are $n$ values, but only $n-1$ options modulo $n-1$, some two of those numbers must be the same modulo
$n-1$. Say $a_{k}\equiv a_{j}\, (\bmod\,n-1)$. That means $a_{k}-a_{j}\equiv 0\,(\bmod\,n-1)$, and that means $n-1$ divides $a_{k}-a_{j}$.

\end{Solution}

\begin{Solution}{32.5}

Let $t_i$ denote the total number of hours studied from day $1$ to day $i$.\\
We are told\\
\[
0<t_1<t_2<\cdots <t_{75} \leq 125.
\]
Adding $24$ to each of those numbers gives
\[
24<t_1+24<t_2+24<\cdots <t_{75}+24 \leq 149.
\]

So we have $150$ numbers (namely $t_1, t_2, \cdots, t_{75}$ and $t_1+24, t_2+24, \cdots ,t_{75}+24$)\\
 all between $1$ and $149$.  By the Pigeonhole Principle some two of those must be equal. Since\\ 
the numbers in the first list are all different, and the numbers int he second list are also all \\
different, it must be that $t_i = t_j + 24$ for some $i$ and $j$. That means $t_i - t_j = 24$. \\
That tells us that on days $j+1, j+2,\cdots , i$, Al studied exactly a total of $24$ hours.
\end{Solution}

\begin{Solution}
 Since
there are only $216$ different values modulo $216$, the pigeonhole principle says
some two of the $217$ numbers, say $m$ and $n$, must have the same value modulo 
$216$. So $m\equiv n\,(mod\,216)$. That means $216\,|\,m-n$. So $m$ and $n$ have 
a difference that is a multiple of $216$.
\end{Solution}
