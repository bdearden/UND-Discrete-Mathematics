\chapter*{Introduction}
\begin{quote}
\newthought{%
Discrete math has become increasingly important in recent years, for a number of reasons:\sidenote{\textit{The Art of Problem Solving} ~\url{http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/articles/discrete-math}}
}

\vspace*{0.25cm}
\noindent
{\large\color{blue}Discrete math is essential to college-level mathematics --- 
and beyond.}

Discrete math --- together with calculus and abstract algebra --- is one of the core
 components of mathematics at the undergraduate level. Students who learn a significant
 quantity of discrete math before entering college will be at a significant advantage
 when taking undergraduate-level math courses.

\vspace*{0.25cm}
\noindent
{\large\color{blue}Discrete math is the mathematics of computing.}

The mathematics of modern computer science is built almost entirely on discrete math,
 in particular combinatorics and graph theory. This means that in order to learn the
 fundamental algorithms used by computer programmers, students will need a solid
 background in these subjects. Indeed, at most universities, a undergraduate-level
 course in discrete mathematics is a required part of pursuing a computer science
 degree.

\vspace*{0.25cm}
\noindent
{\large\color{blue}Discrete math is very much ''real world'' mathematics.}

Many students' complaints about traditional high school math --- algebra, geometry,
 trigonometry, and the like --- is "What is this good for?" The somewhat abstract
 nature of these subjects often turn off students. By contrast, discrete math, in
 particular counting and probability, allows students --- even at the middle school
 level --- to very quickly explore non-trivial "real world" problems that are
 challenging and interesting.

%\vspace*{0.25cm}
\clearpage
\noindent
{\large\color{blue}Discre te math shows up on most middle and high school math contests.}

Prominent math competitions such as MATHCOUNTS (at the middle school level) and the
 American Mathematics Competitions (at the high school level) feature discrete math
 questions as a significant portion of their contests. On harder high school contests,
 such as the AIME, the quantity of discrete math is even larger. Students that do not
 have a discrete math background will be at a significant disadvantage in these
 contests. In fact, one prominent MATHCOUNTS coach tells us that he spends nearly
 50\% of his preparation time with his students covering counting and probability
 topics, because of their importance in MATHCOUNTS contests.

\vspace*{0.25cm}
\noindent
{\large\color{blue}Discrete math teaches mathematical reasoning and proof techniques.}

Algebra is often taught as a series of formulas and algorithms for students to memorize
 (for example, the quadratic formula, solving systems of linear equations by
 substitution, etc.), and geometry is often taught as a series of
 ''definition-theorem-proof'' exercises that are often done by rote (for example, the
 infamous ''two-column proof''). While undoubtedly the subject matter being taught is
 important, the material (as least at the introductory level) does not lend itself
 to a great deal of creative mathematical thinking. By contrast, with discrete
 mathematics, students will be thinking flexibly and creatively right out of the
 box. There are relatively few formulas to memorize; rather, there are a number
 of fundamental concepts to be mastered and applied in many different ways.

\vspace*{0.25cm}         
\noindent
{\large\color{blue}Discrete math is fun.}

Many students, especially bright and motivated students, find algebra, geometry, and even calculus dull and uninspiring. Rarely is this the case with most discrete math topics. When we ask students what their favorite topic is, most respond either ''combinatorics'' or ''number theory.'' (When we ask them what their least favorite topic is, the overwhelming response is ''geometry.'') Simply put, most students find discrete math more fun than algebra or geometry.
